# Jeff Choate's Udacity Neighborhood Project
============================
## Purpose
This project was developed to learn Google maps API, the Knockout framework, and general Javascript coding.
## APIs
This project used the Google Maps API for a map, marker functionality, and information window functionality.
This project also used the Four Square API to retrieve images based on location tags.  The images are retrieved in real time, the location tags were retrieved as part of development and are static in this application.
## Running the Application
**The application requires an internet connection in order to connect to the Four Square and Google Maps APIs.**
### To Run
Simply Load the webpage.  
The markers and list items will both response to mouse over, mouse out, and mouse click events.  

Hover events will only change the color of the markers on the Map.

Click events will display information windows over a marker; or, delete the information window.  There is a maximum of one information window.

There is a button to show and hide the list of locations.  This is useful for mobile devices where the list will cover the map.

There is a search bar to automatically filter the list AND the markers displayed.
